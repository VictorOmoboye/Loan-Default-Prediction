## INTRODUCTION
**LoanAnalytics Inc.**, a leading financial services provider, seeks to enhance its loan evaluation process by implementing an innovative loan default prediction model. With rising economic uncertainties and increasing default rates, traditional methods relying on static borrower data are no longer sufficient. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict default risks more accurately, enabling faster loan approvals, improved risk management, and minimized financial losses. By integrating dynamic borrower data with advanced algorithms, LoanAnalytics Inc. can make smarter, data-driven lending decisions and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.
