  - Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that may influence loan defaults.  
  - Formulate hypotheses to guide feature engineering and model selection.  

- **STEP 3: Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Scale or normalize numerical features and encode categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning models.  
  - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust evaluation.

- **STEP 5: Model Evaluation:**  
  - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
  - Analyze performance across subsets (e.g., borrower income levels) and perform error analysis.  
  - Compare results to a baseline model to measure improvements.  

- **STEP 6: Model Optimization:**  
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.  
  - Apply regularization or ensemble methods to address overfitting and enhance performance.  
  - Refine feature selection and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Numerical Data
During the EDA process on numerical data, univariate and bivariate analyses revealed that the distributions of **Age**, **Income**, **Loan Amount**, **Credit Score**, **Months Employed**, **Interest Rate**, and **DTI Ratio** are uniform, with no outliers detected. The correlation analysis showed moderate relationships among the numerical features, with **Interest Rate** exhibiting a positive correlation of **0.13** with loan defaults, while **Age** displayed a negative correlation of **-0.17** with defaults.

#### Categorical Data
During the EDA process on categorical data, univariate analysis revealed that the distributions of **Education** and **Marital Status** are uniform. Bivariate analysis of **Education** against loan defaults indicated that customers with a **high school education** have the highest likelihood of defaulting, followed by those with a **bachelor's degree**, **master's degree**, and then **PhD holders**, who exhibit the lowest default risk.

### Data Preprocessing 
During the data preprocessing phase, categorical variables were converted to numerical features using **Label Encoding**. The dataset was then split into **80% training** and **20% testing** using the `train_test_split()` function from the **sklearn.model_selection** library. Additionally, feature scaling was applied to ensure consistency in the dataset for model training.

### Model Training
During the model training phase, **Logistic Regression** was initially used to train the dataset, but it yielded unsatisfactory results after evaluation. To improve performance, the **Min-Max Scaler** was applied, as the dataset had a uniform distribution. Following this optimization, additional supervised machine learning models, including **DecisionTreeClassifier**, **SGDClassifier**, and **RandomForestClassifier**, were explored to enhance predictive accuracy and performance.
